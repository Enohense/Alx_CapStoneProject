Virtual Wallet & Payment Gateway Simulator
Tagline: "Simulating the core payment infrastructure behind Paystack, Flutterwave, and modern fintech wallets"
Description: A production-grade REST API that simulates the complete lifecycle of a digital wallet and payment gateway system. Users can create wallets, fund them from external sources, transfer money to other users, withdraw to bank accounts, and view detailed transaction histories. The system implements atomic transactions, webhook processing, ledger reconciliation, and audit trails - mirroring the architecture of real-world payment processors.
Personal Motivation: Working in fintech, I understand that payment infrastructure is the backbone of every financial service. From Paystack processing billions in transactions to Opay facilitating daily peer-to-peer transfers, the ability to move money safely and accurately is critical. This project will give me deep, hands-on experience with:
Transaction atomicity (ensuring money is never lost or duplicated)
Concurrency handling (multiple users transacting simultaneously)
Webhook processing (async payment confirmations)
Ledger accuracy (double-entry bookkeeping principles)
Audit compliance (tracking every financial movement)
These are the exact skills required to build and maintain payment systems at scale.
